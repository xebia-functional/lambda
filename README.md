# AWS Lambda Benchmarking

We compete four languages against one another to establish performance
benchmarks for AWS Lambda and identify cost-saving opportunities:

* [Rust](rust/README.md)
* [Python](python/README.md)
* [TypeScript](typescript/README.md)
* [Scala](scala/README.md)

Details of the contest are available in the [blogpost](https://xebia.com/blog/aws-lambda-benchmarking/). For
specific installation and building instructions, please refer to respective
documentation for each implementation.
